chaotic mess from a dysfunctional brain ;o)<br><br>

* notes to self *<br>
breathe and calm down<br>
dont overload, clear distractions. focus<br>
stand up to wake up<br>
limits are false boundaries<br>
love yourself<br><br>

	You need to calm down your shattered brain; it's healing time.

	Short/long term goals? healthy reminder notes?
	calendar
	discipline diary/progress
		perhaps write/track brain thought path
		learn healthy cbt?
	notes
	potential links/stuff to consume later
-- !!
